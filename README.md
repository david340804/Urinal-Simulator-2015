A simple behavioral model of men picking a urinal

There are two main versions, a command line one and a gui based one.

The men follow three simple rules: 

 1: Go for the urinal with the least men adjacent to you
 
 2: Take an end if open
 
 3: Use the closest option (the men start at urinals[0])

Note: The GUI version has a more robust version of urinalSimulator.js because the console version was just POC

All you really have to read to get it is:
